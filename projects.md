# [Symdiff][4]

A symbolic differentiation library which is able to generate LLVM-IR from its symbolic
representation.

# [Strat3][1]

Strat3 is a general backtester meant to measure performance and diagnostic
strategies. It is mainly built in C++.
The programming design was inspired by Agent Based models in economics. Each action are
broken down into small pieces allowing maximum flexibility.

# [Listener][3]

Simple bot that listens to IRC traffic and builds a package database in SQLite.
A simple GUI is also provided to inspect the resulting database with ease

# [Typer][2]

An experimental functional programing language. Typer combines a proof assitant
and a powerful macro system to generate safer code. I wrote the interpreter, added unit testing, improved error messages and added internal debugging utilities.
