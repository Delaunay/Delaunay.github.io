# [Vanagandr][3]

This is a simple library regrouping different kind of algorithm seen in class for which
I wanted to experiment on. It includes numeric method such as tools for integration and equation solver.
It also includes pricing algorithm such as Binomial Tree and Trinomial Tree (whith different adjustement).

# [Strat3][1]

Strat3 is a general backtester meant to be able to measure the performance and diagnostic
strategies. It is mainly built in C++. Python bindings are currently being implemented.
The programming design was inspired by Agent Based models in economics. Each actions are
broke down into small pieces allowing for a maximum flexibility.
