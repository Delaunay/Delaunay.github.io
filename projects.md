# [Vanagandr][3]

This is a simple library regrouping different kinds of algorithms seen in class which
I wanted to experiment with. It includes numeric methods such as tools for integration and equation solving.
It also includes pricing algorithms such as the Binomial Tree and the Trinomial Tree (with different adjustements).

# [Strat3][1]

Strat3 is a general backtester meant to measure performance and diagnostic
strategies. It is mainly built in C++. Python bindings are currently being implemented.
The programming design was inspired by Agent Based models in economics. Each action are
broken down into small pieces allowing maximum flexibility.
