Summer holidays programming ...

Proof of concept program. 

The idea was to create a program similar to a spreadsheet but
without its short coming:

* Before: A spreadsheet quickly becomes messy, with graphics and variables everywhere
  * Now: Variables and graph appear in a tool box
* Before: Scripting was annoying
  * Now: A Python console is given, allowing you to do whatever you want
* Before: Generalization to other data set is hard
  * Now: Every action is saved as python code and can be executed on any other data set

## Open a table from the main database

## Graphics sidebar

## Variable sidebar, OLS and graphs
